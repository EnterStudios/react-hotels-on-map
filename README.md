# Summary

Presents a set of hotels as clustered markers on Google Map, each with an info window displaying the
hotel name. That's a very simple, narrowly specialized component, tailored for hotels. If you need
something more general, take a look at
[react-google-maps](https://github.com/tomchentw/react-google-maps). Yet another difference from
`react-google-maps` is the React 0.13 support: `react-google-maps` v4+, which is capable of
clustering map markers, requires React 0.14.
